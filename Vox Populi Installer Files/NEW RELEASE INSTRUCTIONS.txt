[Instructions to Create New Release]

I, Recursive, leave these instructions on the proper method to create a new release, in case I perish or am otherwise unable to create new releases.

PREREQUISITES
- CivFanatics Account
- Collaborator permissions on the repository
- Installed Inno Script Studio and Inno Setup Compiler
- Installed ModBuddy
- Installed Python with integration into PATH
- Installed all the tools required to build the DLL
- Installed a Git editor, such as GitHub Desktop
- Cloned local copy of the repository

Tip #1: You may wish to create the autoinstaller in a *COPY* of your repository folder, since ModBuddy will create junk files.
Tip #2: Make sure to merge necessary changes and test your changes to the database and DLL before creating a new release.


[STEP 1]
Make sure you're on the latest master branch.



[STEP 2]
Create a folder somewhere on your computer named "Debug", with two blank folders inside it: "43 Civ" and "Standard".



[STEP 3]
If the new release is savegame incompatible:
- Increment the modinfo version number of (1) Community Patch by one.
- Increment the modinfo minimum savegame compatible version of (1) Community Patch by one.
- For (2), (3a), (3b), (4a) and (4b), increment the modinfo minimum version of the Community Patch (required as a dependency) by 1.

NOTE: .gitignore is set to ignore the Vox Populi Installer Files/(1) Community Patch (v. #) between n and n+10, inclusive, where n is the current version number. Should the version number rise by more than 10, .gitignore will need updating.



[STEP 4]
A. Change the displayed version number on the teasers for the following mods:
- (1) Community Patch
- (2) Vox Populi
- (3a) VP - EUI Compatibility Files
- (3b) 43 Civs Community Patch

Remember that the version number format is "X.Y.Z"
WHERE X = major version number,
Y = savegame incompatible release,
Z = savegame compatible release


B. Change the current version number on ISSUE_TEMPLATE in the main folder to match the new version number.


C. Change MyAppVersion in CPPSetupData.iss to match the new version number.

Tip: Notepad++'s Find in Files feature can be useful for this step, but it will not update ISSUE_TEMPLATE.
Find what: {Old Version Number}
Replace with: {New Version Number}
Filters: *.iss *.civ5proj
Directory: GitHub\Community-Patch-DLL



[STEP 5]
Copy the following folders from the repository and place them in the Vox Populi Installer Files folder:
- (4a) Promotion Icons for VP
- (4b) UI - Promotion Tree for VP



[STEP 6]
Create a commit for the new release, and tag it as shown below. DO NOT PUSH TO GITHUB yet.
Commit Name: "{Version Number} Release"
Tag Name: "Release-{Version Number}"

Tip: This step is necessary to ensure the GameCoreDLL has the correct release identifier, which can be compared later when debugging.


[STEP 7]
A. Build the CvGameCore_Expansion2.dll file using the Release config (instructions are on the main repository page).


B. Place the compiled DLL file in the "(1) Community Patch" folder, replacing the existing DLL there.


C. Open Command Prompt and run the following commands. Leave the window open once you're done.
cd {folder path for Community-Patch-DLL}
py build_vp_clang.py --config debug


D. Go to the clang-output/Debug folder. Cut and paste the compiled DLL and PDB files into the "Standard" folder you created earlier.


E. Delete the clang-output and clang-build folders in the repository.



[STEP 8]
A. Build the 43 Civ version of the game core using the Release config (uncomment "#define MAX_MAJOR_CIVS (43)" in CvGameCoreDLLUtil/include/CustomModsGlobal.h, then build normally).


B. Place the compiled 43 Civ DLL file in the "(3b) 43 Civs Community Patch" folder, replacing the existing DLL there.


C. Using your opened Command Prompt window, run the following command. Close the window when you're done.
py build_vp_clang.py --config debug


D. Go to the clang-output/Debug folder. Cut and paste the compiled DLL and PDB files into the "43 Civ" folder you created earlier.


E. Compress the Debug folder into a .zip file, then delete the unzipped folder.


F. Delete the clang-output and clang-build folders in the repository.



[STEP 9]
Delete the "Release-{Version Number}" tag you've added to the new release commit, and undo the commit.



[STEP 10]
A. Build the following mods in ModBuddy:
- (1) Community Patch
- (2) Vox Populi
- (3a) VP - EUI Compatibility Files
- (3b) 43 Civs Community Patch

B. Copy the compiled mods from your MODS folder and place them in the Vox Populi Installer Files folder.

C. Remove the version numbers at the end of the mod folder names.



[STEP 11]
A. Cut and paste the LUA folder in the (1) Community Patch mod into the "LUA for (1) CP" folder.


B. Cut and paste the LUA folder in the (2) Vox Populi mod into the "LUA for (2) VP" folder.



[STEP 12]
If you've done everything correctly, you can open the CPPSetupData.iss file and hit "Compile". When it finishes, the compiled autoinstaller will be located in the "Output" subfolder.



[STEP 13]
Copy the newly compiled .modinfo files for the following mods from Vox Populi Installer Files to the mods' individual folders in the main folder:
- (1) Community Patch
- (2) Vox Populi
- (3a) VP - EUI Compatibility Files
- (3b) 43 Civs Community Patch



[STEP 14]
Create a commit for the new release, and tag it as shown below.
Commit Name: "{Version Number} Release"
Tag Name: "Release-{Version Number}"



[STEP 15]
Push the release commit to GitHub.



[STEP 16]
A. Go to Releases on GitHub and draft a new release. Upload the compiled autoinstaller and zipped Debug folder to the release binaries.


B. For the Release title, type in "Version {Version Number}".


C. Choose the tag for the new version from the list, and then hit "Generate release notes" above the "Describe this release" text box.


D. Change the text in the box as follows:


**Release Notes Thread:**

**GitHub Changes Summary:** <Insert the link next to "Full Changelog" here>

## Pull Requests Summary
<Insert pull requests list>

<Leave anything else that was added as part of the auto-generated notes at the end>


E. Make sure "Set as a pre-release" is unchecked, and "Set as the latest release" is checked.


F. Publish the release.



[STEP 17]
IF NOT SAVEGAME COMPATIBLE: Make a new version thread on CivFanatics, including the changelog.

IF SAVEGAME COMPATIBLE: Edit the existing release thread on CivFanatics. Edit the title, add the changelog to the OP, and also make a new post in the thread (including the changelog) to alert everyone.

Link to, or update the existing link for, the compiled autoinstaller on the new release's page on GitHub.

After making the thread, copy and paste the forum thread link next to "**Release Notes Thread:**" in the text box from the previous step, and update the release.



[STEP 18]
Announce the new version on Vox Populi's Discord server. If the new release is NOT savegame compatible, ping @everyone in your announcement.
